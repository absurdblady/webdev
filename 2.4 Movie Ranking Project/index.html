 <h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)</h3>
 <p>For me, it’s pure courage on screen. A reminder that daydreams are not escapes but invitations to live bolder.</p>
 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>To me, it feels like a love letter stretched across galaxies. Science makes it vast, but love makes it human.</p>
 <h3>La La Land</h3>
 <p>I see it as a story of sparks that don’t last forever, yet still light up the rest of our lives.</p>
